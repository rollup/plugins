## Contributing

This repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) which leverages [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) for dependency management.

To begin, please install `pnpm`:

```console
$ npm install pnpm -g
```

### Working with Plugin Packages

All plugin packages are kept in the `/packages` directory.

Adding dependencies:

```console
$ pnpm add <package> --filter ./packages/<name>
```

Where `<package>` is the name of the NPM package you wish to add for a plugin package, and `<name>` is the proper name of the plugin. e.g. `@rollup/plugin-beep`.

Publishing:

```console
$ pnpm run publish -- <name>
```

Where `<name>` is the portion of the plugin package name following `@rollup/plugin-`. e.g. `beep`. Publishing will create a new tag in the form of `<name>-v<version>` (e.g. `beep-v0.1.0`) and push the tag to the repo upon successful publish.

Commits for release should be in the form of `chore(release): <name>-v<version>`.

Running Tests:

To run tests on all packages which have changes:

```console
$ pnpm run test
```

To run tests on a specific package:

```console
$ pnpm run test --filter ./packages/<name>
```

Linting:

To lint all packages which have changes:

```console
$ pnpm run lint
```

To lint a specific package:

```console
$ pnpm run lint --filter ./packages/<name>
```

_Note: Scripts in the repository will run the root `test` and `lint` script on those packages which have changes. This is also how the CI pipelines function. To run either on a package outside of that pipeline, use `pnpm run <script> -- @rollup/plugin-<name>`._
